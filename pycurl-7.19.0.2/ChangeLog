Version 7.19.0.2 [requires libcurl-7.19.0 or better] - 2013-10-08
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* Fixed a bug in a commit made in 2008 but not released until 7.19.0.1
	  which caused CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS to not correctly increment reference
	  count of the object being given as its argument, despite libcurl not
	  copying the data provided by said object.

	* Added support for libcurl pause/unpause functionality,
	  via curl_easy_pause call and returning READFUNC_PAUSE from
	  read callback function.

Version 7.19.0.1 [requires libcurl-7.19.0 or better] - 2013-09-23
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* Test matrix tool added to test against all supported Python and
	  libcurl versions.

        * Python 2.4 is now the minimum required version.

        * Source code, bugs and patches are now kept on GitHub.

        * Added CURLINFO_CERTINFO and CURLOPT_CERTINFO.

        * Added CURLOPT_RESOLVE.

        * PycURL can now be used with Python binaries without thread
          support.

        * gcrypt is no longer initialized when a newer version of gnutls
          is used.

        * Marked NSS as supported.

        * Fixed relative URL request logic.

        * Fixed a memory leak in util_curl_init.

        * Added CURLOPT_USERNAME and CURLOPT_PASSWORD.

        * Fixed handling of big timeout values.

        * Added GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR.

        * setopt(..., None) can be used as unsetopt().

        * CURLOPT_RANGE can now be unset.

        * Write callback can return -1 to signal user abort.

        * Reorganized tests into an automated test suite.

        * Added CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION and CURLOPT_SEEKDATA.

        * Cleaned up website.

        * Fix pycurl.reset() (patch by <johansen at sun.com>).

        * Fix install routine in setup.py where
          certain platforms (Solaris, Mac OSX, etc)
          would search for a static copy of libcurl (dbp).

        * Fixed build on OpenSolaris 0906 and other platforms on which
          curl-config does not have a --static-libs option.

        * No longer keep string options copies in the
          Curl Python objects, since string options are
          now managed by libcurl.


Version 7.19.0 [requires libcurl-7.19.0 or better]
--------------------------------------------------

        * Added CURLFILE, ADDRESS_SCOPE and ISSUERCERT options,
          as well as the APPCONNECT_TIME info.

        * Added PRIMARY_IP info (patch by
          Yuhui H <eyecat at gmail.com>).

        * Added support for curl_easy_reset through a
          new 'reset' method on curl objects
          (patch by Nick Pilon <npilon at oreilly.com>).

        * Added support for OPENSOCKET callbacks.
          See 'tests/test_opensocket.py' for example
          usage (patch by Thomas Hunger <teh at camvine.com>).


Version 7.18.2
--------------

        * Added REDIRECT_URL info and M_MAXCONNECTS option
          (patch by Yuhui H <eyecat at gmail.com>).

        * Added socket_action() method to CurlMulti objects.
          See 'tests/test_multi_socket_select.py' for example
          usage (patch by Yuhui H <eyecat at gmail.com>).

        * Added AUTOREFERER option.

        * Allow resetting some list operations (HTTPHEADER,
          QUOTE, POSTQUOTE, PREQUOTE) by passing an empty
          list to setopt (patch by Jim Patterson).


Version 7.18.1
--------------

        * Added POST301, SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5,
          COPYPOSTFIELDS and PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE options.

        * Check for static libs in setup.py to better detect
          whether libcurl was linked with OpenSSL or GNUTLS.

        * PycURL is now dual licensed under the LGPL and
          a license similar to the cURL license (an MIT/X
          derivative).


Version 7.16.4
--------------

        * Allow any callable object as the callback function.
          This change comes handy when you would like to use objects
          which are callable but are not functions or methods, for
          example those objects created by the functions in the functools
          module (patch by Daniel Pena Arteaga <dpena at ph.tum.de>).

        * Added NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS and NEW_FILE_PERMS options.


Version 7.16.2.1
----------------

        * Added IOCMD_NOP and IOCMD_RESTARTREAD for ioctl callback
          handling (patch by Mark Eichin).

        * Use Py_ssize_t where appropriate for Python 2.5 and 64-bit
          compatibility.  This fixes the problem reported by Aaron
          Hill, where the exception "pycurl.error: (2, '')" is thrown
          when calling setopt(pycurl.POSTFIELDS,...) on 64-bit
          platforms.


Version 7.16.2
--------------

        * Added options HTTP_TRANSFER_DECODING, HTTP_CONTENT_DECODING,
          TIMEOUT_MS, CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS from libcurl 7.16.2.

        * Right-strip URLs read from files in the test scripts
          to avoid sending requests with '\n' at the end.


Version 7.16.1
--------------

        * Added constants for all libcurl (error) return codes.  They
          are named the same as the macro constants in curl.h but prefixed
          with E_ instead of CURLE.  Return codes for the multi API are
          prefixed with M_ instead of CURLM.

        * Added CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE,
          CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE, CURLOPT_SSH_AUTH_TYPES.

        * Removed CLOSEPOLICY and friends since this option is now
          deprecated in libcurl.

        * Set the _use_datetime attribute on the CURLTransport class
          to unbreak xmlrpc_curl.py on Python 2.5.


Version 7.16.0 [no public release]
--------------

        * Added CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE.

        * Removed SOURCE_* options since they are no longer
          supported by libcurl.


Version 7.15.5.1
----------------

        * Added test for basic ftp usage (tests/test_ftp.py).

        * Fix broken ssl mutex lock function when using
          GNU TLS (Debian bug #380156, fix by Bastian Kleineidam)


Version 7.15.5
--------------

        * Added CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER,
          CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE,
          and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE.


Version 7.15.4.2
----------------

        * Use SSL locking callbacks, fixes random
          crashes for multithreaded SSL connections
          (patch by Jayne <corvine at gmail.com>).


Version 7.15.4.1
----------------

        * Fixed compilation problem with C compilers
          not allowing declarations in the middle of
          code blocks (patch by
          K.S.Sreeram <sreeram at tachyontech.net>).

        * Fixed bug in curl_multi_fdset wrapping,
          max_fd < 0 is not an error (patch by
          K.S.Sreeram <sreeram at tachyontech.net>).


Version 7.15.4
--------------

        * Added support for libcurl shares, patch from
        Victor Lascurain <bittor at eleka.net>.  See the
        file tests/test_share.py for example usage.

        * Added support for CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH.


Version 7.15.2
--------------

        * Added CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET,
          CURLOPT_LOCALPORT and CURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE.


Version 7.15.1
--------------

2006-01-31 Kjetil Jacobsen <kjetilja>

        * Fixed memory leak for getinfo calls that return a
          list as result.  Patch by Paul Pacheco.


Version 7.15.0
--------------

2005-10-18  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.


Version 7.14.1
--------------

2005-09-05  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH, CURLOPT_COOKIELIST as
          COOKIELIST and CURLINFO_COOKIELIST as INFO_COOKIELIST.


Version 7.14.0
--------------

2005-05-18  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added missing information returned from the info() method
          in the high-level interface.

        * Added the FORM_FILENAME option to the CURLFORM API
          with HTTPPOST.


Version 7.13.2
--------------

2005-03-30  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Unbreak tests/test_gtk.py and require pygtk >= 2.0.

2005-03-15  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Cleaned up several of the examples.

2005-03-11  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * WARNING: multi.select() now requires the previously optional
          timeout parameter.  Updated the tests and examples to reflect
          this change.  If the timeout is not set, select could block
          infinitely and cause problems for the internal timeout handling
          in the multi stack.  The problem was identified by
          <unknownsoldier93 at yahoo.com>.


Version 7.13.1
--------------

2005-03-04  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Use METH_NOARGS where appropriate.

2005-03-03  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for CURLFORM API with HTTPPOST: Supports a
          a tuple with pairs of options and values instead of just
          supporting string contents.  See tests/test_post2.py
          for example usage.  Options are FORM_CONTENTS, FORM_FILE and
          FORM_CONTENTTYPE, corresponding to the CURLFORM_* options,
          and values are strings.

2005-02-13  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Read callbacks (pycurl.READFUNCTION) can now return
          pycurl.READFUNC_ABORT to immediately abort the current transfer.

        * The INFILESIZE, MAXFILESIZE, POSTFIELDSIZE and RESUME_FROM
          options now automatically use the largefile version to handle
          files > 2GB.

        * Added missing pycurl.PORT constant.


Version 7.13.0
--------------

2005-02-10  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added file_upload.py to examples, shows how to upload
          a file.

        * Added CURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION/DATA.

        * Added options from libcurl 7.13.0: FTP_ACCOUNT, SOURCE_URL,
          SOURCE_QUOTE.

        * Obsoleted options: SOURCE_HOST, SOURCE_PATH, SOURCE_PORT,
          PASV_HOST.


Version 7.12.3
--------------

2004-12-22  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS and CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES.

        * Added some other missing constants.

        * Updated pycurl.version_info() to return a 12-tuple
          instead of a 9-tuple.


Version 7.12.2
--------------

2004-10-15  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_FTPSSLAUTH (and CURLFTPAUTH_*).

        * Added CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO.

2004-08-17 Kjetil Jacobsen <kjetilja>

        * Use LONG_LONG instead of PY_LONG_LONG to make pycurl compile
          on Python versions < 2.3 (fix from Domenico Andreoli
          <cavok at libero.it>).


Version 7.12.1
--------------

2004-08-02  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added INFOTYPE_SSL_DATA_IN/OUT.

2004-07-16  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * WARNING: removed deprecated PROXY_, TIMECOND_ and non-prefixed
          INFOTYPE constant names. See ChangeLog entry 2003-06-10.

2004-06-21  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added test program for HTTP post using the read callback (see
          tests/test_post3.py for details).

        * Use the new CURL_READFUNC_ABORT return code where appropriate
          to avoid hanging in perform() when read callbacks are used.

        * Added support for libcurl 7.12.1 CURLOPT features:
          SOURCE_HOST, SOURCE_USERPWD, SOURCE_PATH, SOURCE_PORT,
          PASV_HOST, SOURCE_PREQUOTE, SOURCE_POSTQUOTE.

2004-06-08  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Setting CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS now allows binary data and
          automatically sets CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE for you. If you really
          want a different size you have to manually set POSTFIELDSIZE
          after setting POSTFIELDS.
          (Based on a patch by Martin Muenstermann).

2004-06-05  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added stricter checks within the callback handlers.

        * Unify the behaviour of int and long parameters where appropriate.


Version 7.12
------------

2004-05-18  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * WARNING: To simplify code maintenance pycurl now requires
          libcurl 7.11.2 and Python 2.2 or newer to work.

        * GC support is now always enabled.


Version 7.11.3
--------------

2004-04-30  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Do not use the deprecated curl_formparse function.
          API CHANGE: HTTPPOST now takes a list of tuples where each
          tuple contains a form name and a form value, both strings
          (see test/test_post2.py for example usage).

        * Found a possible reference count bug in the multithreading
          code which may have contributed to the long-standing GC
          segfault which has haunted pycurl.  Fingers crossed.


Version 7.11.2
--------------

2004-04-21  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for libcurl 7.11.2 CURLOPT features:
          CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY.

2004-03-25 Kjetil Jacobsen   <kjetilja>

        * Store Python longs in off_t with PyLong_AsLongLong instead
          of PyLong_AsLong.  Should make the options which deal
          with large files behave a little better.  Note that this
          requires the long long support in Python 2.2 or newer to
          work properly.


Version 7.11.1
--------------

2004-03-16  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * WARNING: Removed support for the PASSWDFUNCTION callback, which
          is no longer supported by libcurl.

2004-03-15  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for libcurl 7.11.1 CURLOPT features:
          CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE.


Version 7.11.0
--------------

2004-02-11  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for libcurl 7.11.0 CURLOPT features:
          INFILESIZE_LARGE, RESUME_FROM_LARGE, MAXFILESIZE_LARGE
          and FTP_SSL.

        * Circular garbage collection support can now be enabled or
          disabled by passing the '--use-gc=[1|0]' parameter to setup.py
          when building pycurl.

        * HTTP_VERSION options are known as CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE,
          CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0, CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1 and
          CURL_HTTP_VERSION_LAST.

2003-11-16  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added support for these new libcurl 7.11.0 features:
          CURLOPT_NETRC_FILE.


Version 7.10.8
--------------

2003-11-04  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added support for these new libcurl 7.10.8 features:
          CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT, CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE,
          CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE,
          CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL, CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL,
          CURL_IPRESOLVE_* constants.

        * Added support for these new libcurl 7.10.7 features:
          CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS, CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH,
          CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE.


2003-10-28  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added missing CURLOPT_ENCODING option (patch by Martijn
          Boerwinkel <xim at xs4all.nl>)


Version 7.10.6
--------------

2003-07-29  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Started working on support for CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION and
          CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA (libcurl-7.10.6) - not yet finished.

2003-06-10  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added support for CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH (libcurl-7.10.6), including
          the new HTTPAUTH_BASIC, HTTPAUTH_DIGEST, HTTPAUTH_GSSNEGOTIATE
          and HTTPAUTH_NTML constants.

        * Some constants were renamed for consistency:

          All curl_infotype constants are now prefixed with "INFOTYPE_",
          all curl_proxytype constants are prefixed with "PROXYTYPE_" instead
          of "PROXY_", and all curl_TimeCond constants are now prefixed
          with "TIMECONDITION_" instead of "TIMECOND_".

          (The old names are still available but will get removed
          in a future release.)

        * WARNING: Removed the deprecated pycurl.init() and pycurl.multi_init()
          names - use pycurl.Curl() and pycurl.CurlMulti() instead.

        * WARNING: Removed the deprecated Curl.cleanup() and
          CurlMulti.cleanup() methods - use Curl.close() and
          CurlMulti.close() instead.


Version 7.10.5
--------------

2003-05-15  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added support for CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPRT (libcurl-7.10.5).

        * Documentation updates.

2003-05-07  Eric S. Raymond  <esr>

        * Lifted all HTML docs to clean XHTML, verified by tidy.

2003-05-02  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Fixed some `int' vs. `long' mismatches that affected 64-bit systems.

        * Fixed wrong pycurl.CAPATH constant.

2003-05-01  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added new method Curl.errstr() which returns the internal
        libcurl error buffer string of the handle.


Version 7.10.4.2
----------------

2003-04-15  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Allow compilation against the libcurl-7.10.3 release - some
        recent Linux distributions (e.g. Mandrake 9.1) ship with 7.10.3,
        and apart from the new CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH option there is
        no need that we require libcurl-7.10.4.


Version 7.10.4
--------------

2003-04-01  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Markus added CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH (libcurl-7.10.4).

2003-02-25  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Fixed some broken test code and removed the fileupload test
        since it didn't work properly.

2003-01-28  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Some documentation updates by Markus and me.

2003-01-22  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * API CHANGE: the CurlMulti.info_read() method now returns
        a separate array with handles that failed.  Each entry in this array
        is a tuple with (curl object, error number, error message).
        This addition makes it simpler to do error checking of individual
        curl objects when using the multi interface.


Version 7.10.3
--------------

2003-01-13  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * PycURL memory usage has been reduced.

2003-01-10  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added 'examples/retriever-multi.py' which shows how to retrieve
        a set of URLs concurrently using the multi interface.

2003-01-09  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES.

2002-11-22  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Updated pycurl documentation in the 'doc' directory.

2002-11-21  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Updated and improved 'examples/curl.py'.

        * Added 'tests/test_multi6.py' which shows how to use the
        info_read method with CurlMulti.

2002-11-19  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added new method CurlMulti.info_read().


Version 7.10.2
--------------

2002-11-14  Kjetil Jacobsen <kjetilja>

        * Free options set with setopt after cleanup is called, as cleanup
        assumes that options are still valid when invoked.  This fixes the
        bug with COOKIEJAR reported by Bastiaan Naber
        <bastiaan at ricardis.tudelft.nl>.

2002-11-06  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Install documentation under /usr/share/doc instead of /usr/doc.
        Also, start shipping the (unfinished) HTML docs and some
        basic test scripts.

2002-10-30  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * API CHANGE: For integral values, Curl.getinfo() now returns a
        Python-int instead of a Python-long.


Version 7.10.1
--------------

2002-10-03  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added new module-level function version_info() from
        libcurl-7.10.


Version 7.10
------------

2002-09-13  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added commandline options to setup.py for specifying the path to
        'curl-config' (non-windows) and the curl installation directory
        (windows).  See the 'INSTALL' file for details.

        * Added CURLOPT_ENCODING, CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL and CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE
        from libcurl-7.10 (by Markus Oberhumer).


Version 7.9.8.4
---------------

2002-08-28  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added a simple web-browser example based on gtkhtml and pycurl.
        See the file 'examples/gtkhtml_demo.py' for details.  The example
        requires a working installation of gnome-python with gtkhtml
        bindings enabled (pass --with-gtkhtml to gnome-python configure).

2002-08-14  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added new method 'select' on CurlMulti objects.  Example usage
        in 'tests/test_multi5.py'.  This method is just an optimization of
        the combined use of fdset and select.

2002-08-12  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for curl_multi_fdset.  See the file
        'tests/test_multi4.py' for example usage.  Contributed by Conrad
        Steenberg <conrad at hep.caltech.edu>.

        * perform() on multi objects now returns a tuple (result, number
        of handles) like the libcurl interface does.

2002-08-08  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added the 'sfquery' script which retrieves a SourceForge XML
        export object for a given project.  See the file 'examples/sfquery.py'
        for details and usage.  'sfquery' was contributed by Eric
        S. Raymond <esr at thyrsus.com>.

2002-07-20  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * API enhancements: added Curl() and CurlMulti() as aliases for
        init() and multi_init(), and added close() methods as aliases
        for the cleanup() methods. The new names much better match
        the actual intended use of the objects, and they also nicely
        correspond to Python's file object.

        * Also, all constants for Curl.setopt() and Curl.getinfo() are now
        visible from within Curl objects.

        All changes are fully backward-compatible.


Version 7.9.8.3
---------------

2002-07-16  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Under Python 2.2 or better, Curl and CurlMulti objects now
        automatically participate in cyclic garbarge collection
        (using the gc module).


Version 7.9.8.2
---------------

2002-07-05  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Curl and CurlMulti objects now support standard Python attributes.
        See tests/test_multi2.py for an example.

2002-07-02  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added support for the multi-interface.


Version 7.9.8.1
---------------

2002-06-25  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Fixed a couple of `int' vs. `size_t' mismatches in callbacks
        and Py_BuildValue() calls.

2002-06-25  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Use 'double' type instead of 'size_t' for progress callbacks
        (by Conrad Steenberg <conrad at hep.caltech.edu>).  Also cleaned up
        some other type mismatches in the callback interfaces.

2002-06-24  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added example code on how to upload a file using HTTPPOST in
        pycurl (code by Amit Mongia <amit_mongia at hotmail.com>).  See the
        file 'test_fileupload.py' for details.


Version 7.9.8
-------------

2002-06-24  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Resolved some build problems on Windows (by Markus Oberhumer).

2002-06-19  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_CAPATH.

        * Added option constants for CURLOPT_NETRC: CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL,
        CURL_NETRC_IGNORED and CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED.

        * Added option constants for CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION:
        TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE and TIMECOND_IFUNMODSINCE.

        * Added an simple example crawler, which downloads documents
        listed in a file with a configurable number of worker threads.
        See the file 'crawler.py' in the 'tests' directory for details.

        * Removed the redundant 'test_xmlrpc2.py' test script.

        * Disallow recursive callback invocations (by Markus Oberhumer).

2002-06-18  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Made some changes to setup.py which should fix the build
        problems on RedHat 7.3 (suggested by Benji <benji at kioza.net>).

        * Use CURLOPT_READDATA instead of CURLOPT_INFILE, and
        CURLOPT_WRITEDATA instead of CURLOPT_FILE.  Also fixed some
        reference counting bugs with file objects.

        * CURLOPT_FILETIME and CURLINFO_FILETIME had a namespace clash
        which caused them not to work.  Use OPT_FILETIME for setopt() and
        INFO_FILETIME for getinfo().  See example usage in
        'test_getinfo.py' for details.


Version 7.9.7
-------------

2002-05-20  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * New versioning scheme.  Pycurl now has the same version number
        as the libcurl version it was built with.  The pycurl version
        number thus indicates which version of libcurl is required to run.

2002-05-17  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME and CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT.

2002-04-27  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Fixed potential memory leak and thread race (by Markus
        Oberhumer).


Version 0.4.9
-------------

2002-04-15  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION to allow debug callbacks to be
        specified (see the file 'test_debug.py' for details on how to use
        debug callbacks).

        * Added CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE and
        CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT.

        * Fixed a segfault when finalizing curl objects in Python 1.5.2.

        * Now requires libcurl 7.9.6 or greater.

2002-04-12  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added 'test_post2.py' file which is another example on how to
        issue POST requests.

2002-04-11  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added the 'test_post.py' file which demonstrates the use of
        POST requests.


Version 0.4.8
-------------

2002-03-07  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLOPT_PREQUOTE.

        * Now requires libcurl 7.9.5 or greater.

        * Other minor code cleanups and bugfixes.

        be determined.

        * Check that the installed version of libcurl matches the
        requirements of pycurl.

2002-02-26  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Clarence Garnder <clarence at silcom.com> found a bug where string
        arguments to setopt sometimes were prematurely deallocated, this
        should now be fixed.

2002-02-21  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added the 'xmlrpc_curl.py' file which implements a transport
        for xmlrpclib (xmlrpclib is part of Python 2.2).

        * Added CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE.

        * Added CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, CURLOPT_SSLKEY, CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE,
        CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD, CURLOPT_SSLENGINE and
        CURLOPT_SSLENGINE_DEFAULT.

        * When thrown, the pycurl.error exception is now a tuple consisting
        of the curl error code and the error message.

        * Now requires libcurl 7.9.4 or greater.

2002-02-19  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Fixed docstring for getopt() function.

2001-12-18  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Updated the INSTALL information for Win32.

2001-12-12  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added missing link flag to make pycurl build on MacOS X (by Matt
        King <matt at gnik.com>).

2001-12-06  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME and CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV from
        libcurl 7.9.2.

2001-12-01  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * Added the 'test_stringio.py' file which demonstrates the use of
        StringIO objects as callback.

2001-12-01  Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <mfx>

        * setup.py: Do not remove entries from a list while iterating
        over it.

2001-11-29  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added code in setup.py to install on Windows.  Requires some
        manual configuration (by Tino Lange <Tino.Lange at gmx.de>).

2001-11-27  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Improved detection of where libcurl is installed in setup.py.
        Should make it easier to install pycurl when libcurl is not
        located in regular lib/include paths.

2001-11-05  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Some of the newer options to setopt were missing, this should
        now be fixed.

2001-11-04  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Exception handling has been improved and should no longer throw
        spurious exceptions (by Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer
        <markus at oberhumer.com>).

        * Refactored the test_gtk.py script to avoid global variables.

2001-10-12  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Added module docstrings, terse perhaps, but better than nothing.

        * Added the 'basicfirst.py' file which is a Python version of the
        corresponding Perl script by Daniel.

        * PycURL now works properly under Python 1.5 and 1.6 (by Markus
        F.X.J. Oberhumer <markus at oberhumer.com>).

        * Allow C-functions and Python methods as callbacks (by Markus
        F.X.J. Oberhumer <markus at oberhumer.com>).

        * Allow None as success result of write, header and progress
        callback invocations (by Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer
        <markus at oberhumer.com>).

        * Added the 'basicfirst2.py' file which demonstrates the use of a
        class method as callback instead of just a function.

2001-08-21  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>

        * Cleaned up the script with GNOME/PycURL integration.

2001-08-20  Kjetil Jacobsen  <kjetilja>
