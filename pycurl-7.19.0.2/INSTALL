NOTE: You need Python and libcurl installed on your system to use or
build pycurl.  Some RPM distributions of curl/libcurl do not include
everything necessary to build pycurl, in which case you need to
install the developer specific RPM which is usually called curl-dev.


Distutils
---------

Build and install pycurl with the following commands:

    (if necessary, become root)
    tar -zxvf pycurl-$VER.tar.gz
    cd pycurl-$VER
    python setup.py install

$VER should be substituted with the pycurl version number, e.g. 7.10.5.

Note that the installation script assumes that 'curl-config' can be
located in your path setting.  If curl-config is installed outside
your path or you want to force installation to use a particular
version of curl-config, use the '--curl-config' commandline option to
specify the location of curl-config.  Example:

    python setup.py install --curl-config=/usr/local/bin/curl-config

If libcurl is linked dynamically with pycurl, you may have to alter the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable accordingly.  This normally
applies only if there is more than one version of libcurl installed,
e.g. one in /usr/lib and one in /usr/local/lib.


Windows
-------

When installing on Windows, you need to manually configure the path to
the curl source tree, specified with the CURL_DIR variable in the file
'setup.py'.  The CURL_DIR variable can also be set using the
commandline option '--curl-dir' when invoking setup.py:

    python setup.py install --curl-dir=c:\curl-7.10.5
